Sexual orientation may be conceputualised as a 'For' sexual desire. Gender may be conceptualised as a 'As' sexual desire. The former is a relation to the object of one's desire and the latter a relation to the one self as the subject.

It is easy to think that one's as desire as a person of a recieving disposition can be confuse with a desire to be with a recieving person.
