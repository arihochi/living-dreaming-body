# General

1. Understanding the passage requires us to take into account the parts of a text (E.g A verse from Paul's letter) and the letter as a whole (E.g. Paul's whole letter). The mutually inform each other and give us clues on how to read a difficult section or phrase.

# Using Greek

1. Tense is a contested concept in Greek. Some believe that there is no time component in Greek and others that time is only relevant in the in the indicative mood and other. Some believe that the fundamental semantic force of Greek is aspect (D.A. Carson, Exegetical Fallacies, 1996)

2. The aorist has been misunderstood as giving special meaning or emphasis to a point or an action. However, this is not the case, it simply means that something has happened and is a way of referencing an action. (College)

3. The middle voice is misunderstood when ones assumes that it always has a reflexive meaning or suggestion that subject is acting of itself. (D.A. Carson, Exegetical Fallacies, 1996)
