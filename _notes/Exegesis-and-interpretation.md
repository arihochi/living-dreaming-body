# General

1. Understanding the passage requires us to take into account the parts of a text (E.g A verse from Paul's letter) and the letter as a whole (E.g. Paul's whole letter). They mutually inform each other and give us clues on how to read a difficult section or phrase.

# Using Greek

1. Tense is a contested concept in Greek. Some believe that there is no time component in Greek and others that time is only relevant in the in the indicative mood and other. Some believe that the fundamental semantic force of Greek is aspect (D.A. Carson, Exegetical Fallacies, 1996)

2. The aorist has been misunderstood as giving special meaning or emphasis to a point or an action. However, this is not the case, it simply means that something has happened and is a way of referencing an action. (College)

3. The middle voice is misunderstood when ones assumes that it always has a reflexive meaning or suggestion that subject is acting of itself. (D.A. Carson, Exegetical Fallacies, 1996)

4. We need to remember that Paul didn't have Wallace's grammar in front of him and is choosing which genitive he is using. We need to think about what is actually happening (M.S. College lecturer)

# Word studies

1. Words don't have Meanings they have usages. This prevents us from falling into a trap where we claim that certain words must have one particular meaning (M.S. College lecturer).

# Approaching reading the bible

1. We should not approach the bible primarily through word studies. It older hermeneutics, one would look for the particular meanings of words and build up a sense of meaning through the accumulation of words and word parts. However, this is an artificial process and misunderstands the utility of words. Words don't have meanings in themselves but have meaning through the ways that they are used in the context that they exist in. Therefore, we should use a birds eye view rather than a worms eye view when reading the scriptures. The bird eye view involves reading the text as a whole and understanding the larger focus of the text. Through this we approach the text through the unit of thoughts or speech acts. As we go deeper we refine our understanding of these thoughts or speech acts until the context is able to help us understand how each word should be properly understood. (Ben Shin, 2012, You tube, Understanding Hermeneutics and bible translations) Such arguments sound like, "Given what Paul is trying to do in the larger context... He probably means this in this verse".
