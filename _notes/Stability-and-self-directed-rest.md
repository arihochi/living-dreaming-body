Seedling ðŸŒ±, this note begin stores some wisdom to direct me in self directed rest. This will help me grow in stability for ministry. 

# Painting a narrative for sustainable ministry

Cross cultural and minority ministry are often at the frontiers of Gospel need and growth. However, by this nature, they also place particular demands and stresses on those who choose to work in this area.

Gospel workers are called to generate and model new ways living out the same gospel in a new context. They are often on the forefront of responding to minority stresses and their resulting mental and physical strains. At its serious but still common end, mental illness, traumas, family breakdown and fiscal poverty may arise.

As I have noticed in my own ministry and in the ministry of others, ministry growth and relational depth can be generated through hurried and unbalanced activity. It might even be necessary for a time when a ministry is just beginning. However, it does not and cannot sustain a healthy spiritual community in the long term. Confusions arise, misunderstandings form and suspicions and anxieties begin to fester.

As with any ministry, but particularly in this space of need, there is an opportunity and perhaps an imperative for the leader to work towards creating a sense of stability in the community and in themselves. the former being predicated on the latter.

Such stability takes the form of an non-anxious and unhurried presence. This facilitates the calm of those we care for and allows us to be approached by those under our care. As we do this, we model the patterns of a full life. We model dependence on God, sharing difficulties well and loving each other in a non-anxious way (Peter Brain, Going the Distance, p21).

# Personal stability

Now, having meditated on the importance of personal stability in ministry, this section is dedicated to the practice of generating such stability.

Firstly, a meditation on the personal motivation of stability. We should aim to finish the race well. In order to love our community, we should seek to maintain ourselves. To burn out is to leave our community without a shepherd, orphaned after placing a trust in us. It is a grief premature and spiritual figure lost. We should seek not the pride and hubris of going out in a blaze of glory but to the wisdom and humility of finishing the race well for Jesus. (Peter Brain, Going the Distance, p10)

Secondly, we should not always aim to work at 100% strength. We should "do the things that we are called to do, and then the things that we can responsibly undertake". (Peter Brain, Going the Distance, p 18)

Thirdly, core activities to building stability in ministry are prayer, preparation and reflection. These are activities and practices that help to orient us to the task of ministry. What we make our practices today slowly become permanent in our lives (Peter Brain, Going the Distance, p18,20). We should make a plan that facilitates these tasks regularly.

Forth, we should nurture and be nurtured by our friends and family. 

Fifth, Self denial refers to our "motivational self" while self care refers to our "structural self".
