# Exegetical toolkit 

Reminders that guide me towards humble interpretation of the Bible

“If there are so many exegetical traps, so many hermeneutical pitfalls, how can I ever be confident that I am rightly interpreting and preaching the Scriptures?… To such students, I can Only say that you will make more mistakes if you fail to embark on such a study as this than you will if you face the tough questions and improve your skills. The big difference is that in the former case you will not be aware of the mistakes you are making. If you are genuinely concerned about the quality of your ministry, and not just about your own psychological insecurity, that will be an unacceptable alternative. Ignorance may be bliss, but it is not a virtue.” (D.A. Carson, Exegetical Fallacies, p22-23)

## Distanciation before fusion

At college we are taught to read the biblical text critically. That is, we are tasked with giving sound reasons for one interpretation of the biblical text over another. To do this well, we create distance and grasp the “degree of differences” between our interpretation of what the text is saying and what the text is actually saying. (D.A. Carson, Exegetical Fallacies, p24)

“Only after this can we profitably fuse our horizon of understanding with the origin of understanding of the text—that is, only then can we begin to shape our thoughts by the thoughts of the text so that we truly understand them. Failure to go through the distanciation before the fusion usually means that there has been no really fusion: the interpreter thinks he knows what the text means, but all too often he or she has simply imposed his own thoughts onto the text.” (D.A. Carson, Exegetical Fallacies, p24)
 
Distanciation is necessary but not an end to itself, it’s corrective is fusion. To do this, we must learn both the skill of distanciation and of interpretation. We need to work hard at integrating these things and their outcomes as part of our Christian walk and commitment. (D.A. Carson, Exegetical Fallacies, p24)
 
## Exegesis vs Hermeneutics

The difference of Exegesis and Hermeneutics lies in the end of the two disciplines. A simple definition may look is described. At the outcome of exegesis one might say “This passage means such and such”. Exegesis is concerned with actually interpreting the text. However, hermeneutics is concerned with interpretive process. “Hermeneutics ends with saying, ‘the interpretative process is constituted but the following techniques and pre-understandings”. (D.A. Carson, Exegetical Fallacies, p25)

Hermeneutics serves exegesis and should not be carried out without this in mind.

## Why Intepret?

We must go beyond the discipline of exegesis. That is, the discernment of what is in the text, into the reconstruction of the thoughts of the biblical authors. (inspired by: Moo, A theology of Paul and his letters, 2021, p8). Another way to understand this, is a distinction between what a text states explicitly, and what a text communicates implicitly. We are called to read the lines of text and not merely to remain there, we are also to read between the lines of scripture. (Phillip Long, Reading between the lines: On Discerning the implicit messages of scripture, 2021) Biblical truth is explicit, but the whole truth is implicit. (ibid.) 

However, there is good reconstruction and bad reconstruction. Postmodernism has given helped us to understand that different perspectives (feminist, queer, liberationist, etc.) allow us to see and clarify different things as they appear in the text. However, it is important to be constrained by the lines themselves and not to read outside of the lines. To do so, is to read outside of the boundary lines established by the text.

We must privileged a reading of the text where its implicit and explicit reading are in agreement rather than one where there are in conflict. The interpretation of the lines of scripture should not stand in conflict with the lines themselves. To read between the lines is to do it in two senses. It is to both reach for the implicit meaning of the text and to be constrained by the text's more explicit messages. (ibid.)
