title: Paul in Pauline theology
---

Seedling, this note begins to think about how to do Pauline theology well.

Paul is a working theologian and not an academic theologian. This means that he is not writing his letters as a way to share a systematic theology that he is thinking about. Rather, he is writing to a particular audience and sharing the theology that has been reveal to him through his experiences of God.

Some writers have note that his though may change during the course of his letters or even contradict themselves. According to Moo (2021, p9), these differences reveal a development of Paul's ideas that did not entail contradiction. 

As we do Pauline theology, we access Paul's thought through his letters and humbly enter it to find its framework and contents (Moo 2021, p7)
