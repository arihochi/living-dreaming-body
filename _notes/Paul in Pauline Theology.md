title: Paul in Pauline theology
---

Seedling ðŸŒ±, this note begins to think about how to do Pauline theology well.

# Paul and theology

Paul is a working theologian and not an academic theologian. This means that he is not writing his letters as a way to share a systematic theology that he is thinking about. Rather, he is writing to a particular audience and sharing the theology that has been revealed to him through his experiences of God.

Some writers have note that his though may change during the course of his letters or even contradict themselves. According to Moo (2021, p9), these differences reveal a development of Paul's ideas that did not entail contradiction. 

As we do Pauline theology, we access Paul's thought through his letters and humbly enter it to find its framework and contents (Moo 2021, p7)

# Steps in Pauline theology

1. We are to look at his letters and find the bits that relate to a topic. This is exegesis.
2. Then we reconstruct the coherent set of beliefs that generate the specific set of teachings found in this letters. This is theological synthesis.

The argument is as follows: Background framework of belief X best explains bits A, B and C in his letters. 

Throughout this process, we need to note our sources. Do we use so called deutero-pauline letters or acts? We might also encounter works that believe in a particular centre to Pauls writing. Do we see a centre in Paul's work?


# Misc

It synthesising the bits of Pauls thinking. He didn't write a book called the theology of Paul, he is a task or missionary theologian. Romans has been thought of as the template. It is the only thing that seems a little systematic, yet it isn't 

Jame Dunn did this in the theology of Paul. 


1. Go to all of his letters and finding the bits that relate to a topic and then summarising them. 
2. To reconstruct the broader framework that lies behind all of those thoughts. The coherant set of believes that lie behind and generate the specific set of teachings found in his letters (Doug Moo).

See A B C underlying all of that seems to be a General D


Therefore, you have to do exegesis. You have to start with the individual text and then move beyond into some theological synthesis. 

Note that the categories that we have may not be the ones we have. Paul might not be written to answer 21st century questions. We need to see how he is writing to the 1st century context. His thinking may challenge our categories. 


show that we do exegesis
show that we put it together into some synthesis 

Priority of is pauls letters but it will be in a timeline. 
Acts can be used, but non-evangelical sources need to defend.
Act is lukes presentation in paul's thought.
Only 7 undisputed Pauline letters.
The pastorals are not pauline

what are your sources and why?
do they have a centre explicit or implied? Do you have one?

how do we put paul together.



the theological centre of paul - a big idea. Gives clarity but the danger is suppressing another part.

1. justification by faith - only in major discussion in 2 letter
2. salvation history and Christ its centre - maybe less a centre than a framework
3. christ centre
4. Jesus' victory
5. Union with Christ - ep sanders, doug moo, schiwzer

Key themes
gentile inclusion
faith 
grace
God

what is the centre? the foundation everything is built on or the target?
